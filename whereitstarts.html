      <p>I’ve long wanted to <a href="https://rossbreadmore.medium.com/building-a-website-5353ac6772f7">make my own website</a>; partly as I work in digital and feel I ought to, and increasingly as I age I see platforms come and go, and so want something within my own control that can house the various things I make. 

        I’ve had several failed attempts, but thanks to AI I’ve now got the shortcuts I need to do it easily. Using ChatGPT I got some basic HTML and CSS, and it recommend netlify as a platform for hosting. I was then pushing code from my own github (the most engineering I’ve ever felt), and I’m now happy with V1 as a basic site. 
        
        I’m writing this post as a statement of intent, and a reminder to myself of where it started. Over the coming months I’d like to expand the website in the following ways:
        
       

        <ul>
          <li>A slicker, more personal design. Cool big type and graphics.</li>
          <li>Interesting IA, that doesn’t follow the usual ‘about’, ‘blog’, ‘etc’ standard sections. </li>
          <li>A method of storing / displaying video that doesn’t rely on vimeo or youtube.</li>
          <li>Long-form written content to replace how I use medium.</li>
          <li>Moving graphics and interactions. </li>
          <li>Gallery for photography / illustration.</li>
          <li>Analytics so I can quantify the inevitable hoards that will clamber over all of the better designed websites to see mine.</li>
          <li>A load of other things that’ll come to me in time.</li>

        </ul>
      </p>
