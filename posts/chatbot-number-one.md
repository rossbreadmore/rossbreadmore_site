Using Chatbase I created a simple chatbot, for a few reasons:

1. To see how easy it was to embed into this site. 
2. To see what configuration options exist. 
3. To see what kind of training is now available on bot-builder platforms. 

In summary it was far simpler than I thought. Using the free Chatbase tier I was able to train a bot on a [blogpost](https://rossbreadmore.medium.com/55-things-72cb667818cb) I often share with teams, and then embed into my site with help from ChatGPT. 

Even with this basic version of the platform, a couple of immediate use-cases spring to mind…

- **Librarian / helper bots** embedded within work platforms to help with specific tasks. Onboarding is a repeating challenge for large challenges, specifically due to the vast amount of data thrown at new joiners, with little dialogue. Using Chatbase or similar you could easily ingest a whole load of legacy data and then give new joiners a friendly guide.
- **Education bots** - given the platform can ingest and be trained from PDFs, it’d be easy to create topic-specific experts in niche areas, and provide guidance on how to interact (see image below) to ensure the response types suited the audience.

Next I want to get into more agentic versions of this technology, with bots that can execute actions on behalf of the user. For now, here are some images of Rossbot3000 in action as I’ll likely remove it in future.
