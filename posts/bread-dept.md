I love working within large and complex companies, but increasingly I'm fascinated by what my own thing could be. I've been bouncing ideas around with ChatGPT and thought I'd share, as this will be a long journey and it'll be good to look back...

**Welcome to The Bread Dept.**

*You are now part of a quiet uprising.*. 
We bake ideas, not decks. We proof systems, not slogans.  
And we never deliver anything fully baked — that’s the point.  
- We work with clients to fake the future just well enough that it breaks the present open.
- Our tools are fiction. Our output is culture. Our medium is collaboration.

**House Rules (Selected Slices)**
- **🥖 Half-baked is honest**  
    We don’t overcook ideas. If it’s too polished, we’ve probably killed something.
- **🍞 Serve warm**  
    Share early. Share often. Friction is flavor.
- **🥐 All crumb, no crust**  
    We break silos, not bread. Everyone’s input gets folded in.
- **🧈 Butter both sides**  
    Design fiction is strategy. Culture is process. Everything overlaps.
- **🫓 Flat, not hierarchical**  
    We work like it’s already 2033 — async, autonomous, and radically transparent.

**A Typical Project (Unfolded)**
🌀 Step 1: Create Fictional Clarity.

We make provocative artifacts: memos from 2032, posters from impossible futures, screenshots from sideways timelines. These are mirrors — distorted just enough to be revealing.

🌀 Step 2: Work in the Future.

We run sprints using progressive practices:
- No decks, just stories.
- No check-ins, just shared documents.
- No bosses, just leads of the week.

🌀 Step 3: Land it Back on Earth.

We help clients ask: “What if this were real? What would we do next?”
Then we help them start doing it.

🧠 *By the end, the client has not just seen the future, they’ve practiced a better present.*

**Bread Dept. Archetypes**
We don’t have job titles. We have types of yeast:
- The Starter – loves ambiguity, always begins
- The Kneader – brings structure and tension
- The Fermenter – lets things rise without touching them
- The Slicer – finds the story inside the mess

You might be one. You might be all four.
Just don't try to be the toaster.

**The Unofficial FAQ**
Q: Are we consultants, artists, or saboteurs?
A: Yes.

Q: Is this satire?
A: Only if you’re afraid it’s true.

Q: What happens if we fail?
A: You just invented a new future.


**THE BREAD DEPT.**
**We’re not predicting the future.**
**We’re letting you borrow it — just long enough to make today worth reworking.**
