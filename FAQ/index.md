**Who are you?**  
I'm Ross Breadmore â€” design director working in finance (see LinkedIn link below) and an amateur film maker, writer and coder (thanks to a lot of AI help).

**What's this site?**   
I wanted a my own online space for a few reasons:

- Experience has taught me that 3rd party platforms come and go and so I wanted my own thing that won't suddenly become paywalled or obselete.
- AI has enabled me to create / code my own site and it's good for me to see how repos, text editors etc work. 
- 10 years from now I'd love to look back and see how naive and basic some of this will seem. 

**What is this site not?**  
This site is not affiliated to my day job, nor is it designed to be professional or finished. It will contain typos, broken links and weird opinions. It's also not a commercial venture - although I'm hoping it could lead to some interesting ideas I might want to develop. 

**Can I contact you?**  
A message on LinkedIn is probably easiest - there's a link below. 

**Why bother with an FAQ?**  
It's a fun part of any site, and I'm a big fan of Mr Bingo and his [FAQ](https://mr.bingo/about/).
