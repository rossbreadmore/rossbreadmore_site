## FAQ

**Q: Who are you?**  
A: I'm Ross Breadmore â€” design director working in finance and an amateur film maker, writer and coder (thanks to a lot of AI help).

**Q: What's this site?**  
A: I wanted a my own online space for a few reasons:
- Experience has taught me that 3rd party platforms come and go.
- AI has enabled me to create / code my own site and it's good for me to see how repos, text editors etc work. 
- 10 years from now I'd love to look back and see how naive and basic some of this will seem. 

**Q: What is this site not?**  
A: This site is not affiliated to my day job, nor is it designed to be professional or finished. It will contain typos, broken links and weird opinions. It's also not a commercial venture (although I'm hoping it could lead to some interesting ideas I might want to develop).
